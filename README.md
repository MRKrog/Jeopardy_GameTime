## Reflection
> This project was the first instance of using Javascript object oriented principles, along with webpack. The initial start of the project was the hardest because compared to traditional functional Javascript, you had to methodically plan how and where each Classes/Instances & their methods would interact with each other. This project was a great eye opener in the power of instances and how objects can build powerful applications.
